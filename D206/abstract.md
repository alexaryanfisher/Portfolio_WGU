## D206: Data Cleaning within Python

### Course Summary
This course teaches students how to use Python to clean and prepare data for analysis. Students will learn how to:

* Explore data to identify errors and inconsistencies
* Transform data into a consistent format
* Impute missing values
* Resolve outliers
* Structure data for analysis
* Reduce the size of datasets

The course also covers the importance of data cleaning in the data analytics lifecycle. Students will learn how data cleaning can improve the accuracy and reliability of data analysis results.

### Objectives

- Predicting Obstacles in Data Analysis: Predicting potential obstacles in data analysis based on the quality of data provided.
- Preparing Data for Analysis: Preparation of data for analysis to address organizational needs.
- Manipulating Data for Analysis: Written reusable code to manipulate and clean data in preparation for analysis

### Assessments and Deliverables

The course has one assessment in the form of a written report and a video presentation. The assessment is based on a project that requires students to use Python in the Jupyter Notebook environment to import an external .csv file, explore the data, and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

The written report should describe the project in detail, including the steps taken to import the .csv file, explore the data, and perform PCA. The video presentation should demonstrate the project and explain the results of PCA.

The assessment is designed to assess students' ability to:
- Import data into a Jupyter Notebook environment
- Explore data using Python
- Perform PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset

*Please note that the provided dataset will be used throughout the program with various modifications. This is to ensure that students are familiar with the dataset and can apply the skills they learn in this course to other datasets.*

My research question for this project was *“Does the amount of telecommunication services affect the yearly service failures per household size?”*. I decided to utilize various functions and Python libraries/packages to clean the dataset.
