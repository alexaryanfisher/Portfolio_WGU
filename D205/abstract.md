## D205: Data Acquisition within PostgreSQL

### Course Summary
This course teaches students how to use Structured Query Language (SQL) to acquire and analyze data. 
Students will learn how to:

-Create and manage relational databases
-Write SQL queries to extract data from databases
-Manipulate data in databases
-Transfer data between databases

The course also introduces students to the data analytics lifecycle, from data acquisition to data visualization. Students will learn how to:

-Identify the data they need to answer a question
-Clean and prepare the data for analysis
-Use statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the data
-Visualize the results of their analysis

### Objectives

- Dimension, Quality Relationships, and Limitations: Examination of the data available for analysis to determine dimensions, quality, relationships, and limitations.
- Physical Data Models: Implementation of physical data models.
- Table Operations: Performance of table operations and queries within the context of data acquisition for analysis.

### Assessments and Deliverables

The course has one assessment in the form of a written report and a video presentation. The assessment is based on a project that requires students to import an external .csv file into an existing PostgreSQL database as a new table. After the import, students must explore the database and generate queries to solve a research question that they pose.
My research question for this project was *"How many customers selected the internet service ‘Fiber Optic’ for each economic income class per state?".*. I decided to utilize a complex query involving common table expressions and various calculations to reach my final results.
